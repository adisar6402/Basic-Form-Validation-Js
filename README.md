# Basic-Form-Validation-Js
This repository contains a hands-on exercise for basic form validation using JavaScript. It features registration and login forms with client-side validation, including checks for required fields, email format, password strength, age (18-100), and terms acceptance. The goal is to enhance user input reliability before form submission.
